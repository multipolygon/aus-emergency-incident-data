Weather conditions are predicted to deteriorate later today, with increased smoke reducing visibility and air quality.QFES and QPWS in conjunction with the Butchulla people are working to limit the spread of the fire and minimise environmental and cultural impacts. Travel to the island remains restricted.Residents, campers and visitors already on the island should limit their movements to within close proximity of where they are staying and avoid travelling on the inland tracks and roads. Additional closures of inland roads and tracks are likely.For further information regarding travel restrictions, permits and track closures go to www.parks.des.qld.gov.au.Properties are not under direct threat at this time. Call Triple Zero (000) immediately if you believe you or your property is under threat.\nResponse Time: 20201014132325\nVehicles on Scene:15\nVehicles on Route: 0",
